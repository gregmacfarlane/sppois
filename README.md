[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gregmacfarlane/sppois.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gregmacfarlane/sppois)

An implementation of the two-stage limited information maximumum likelihood
estimator for spatial autoregressive Poisson models proposed by [Lambert et al.
(2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.regsciurbeco.2010.04.001)

This package is built on top of functions and methods available in
[`spdep`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/index.html), and could
potentially be merged into that package.
